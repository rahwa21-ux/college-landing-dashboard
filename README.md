## Tools / Libraries Used

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahwa21-ux/college-landing-dashboard.git
   ## Approach
   I structured the project using React functional components and hooks for state management.
   The landing page has a hero section with a call-to-action, followed by feature cards, statistics, and testimonials to make it visually attractive.
   The signup and login pages include basic form validation.
   The dashboard displays interactive cards and statistics with hover animations, maintaining the color scheme of gold, gray, and blue-black throughout for consistency.
   Responsive design was applied to make the pages look good on both mobile and desktop devices.
